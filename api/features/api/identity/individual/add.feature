Feature: Add individual identities

  Background:
    Given I am authenticated as the "system@system.ds" user from the tenant "b6ac25fe-3cd6-4100-a054-6bba2fc9ef18"

  Scenario: Add a individual identity
    When I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"

    """
    {
      "owner": "BusinessUnit",

      "roles": [],
      "version": 1
    }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
